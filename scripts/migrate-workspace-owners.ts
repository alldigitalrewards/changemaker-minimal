 * OBSOLETE: Migration script for ownerId field
 * 
 * This script is no longer needed as the ownerId field has been removed
 * from the Workspace model in favor of using WorkspaceMembership with
 * isPrimary flag to determine ownership.
 * 
 * Ownership is now determined by:
 * WorkspaceMembership.role = 'ADMIN' AND WorkspaceMembership.isPrimary = true
 * 
 * This file is kept for historical reference but should not be run.
