## Workflow Integration

### Task Master Integration
Both roadmaps are designed to work with Task Master AI for task breakdown, dependency tracking, and progress monitoring.

**Commands**:
```bash
# Parse roadmap into tasks
task-master parse-prd .claude/plans/implementation-roadmap.md

# View next available task
task-master next

# Mark task complete
task-master set-status --id=<id> --status=done
```

### Progress Tracking
- Use `.claude/PROGRESS.md` for overall project status updates
- Create session logs in `.claude/sessions/` for detailed implementation notes
- Update roadmap files as phases complete

---

## Conventions

### Roadmap Structure
All roadmaps follow this structure:
1. **Overview** - Current status, phase completion, key dependencies
2. **Phases** - Organized by week/milestone with clear deliverables
3. **Tasks** - Detailed task breakdown with time estimates and risk assessment
4. **Success Metrics** - Measurable criteria for each phase
5. **Risk Mitigation** - Known risks and mitigation strategies
6. **References** - Links to related documentation

### Task Format
Each task includes:
- Task number and title
- Time estimate
- File paths affected
- Dependencies on other tasks
- Deliverable description
- Risk assessment

### Status Indicators
- ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Task finished and verified
- üéØ READY - Dependencies met, ready to start
- ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING - Blocked or awaiting dependencies
- üìã PLANNED - Documented but not yet ready

## Adding New Roadmaps

When creating a new roadmap:

1. Create file: `.claude/plans/feature-name-roadmap.md`
2. Follow the standard roadmap structure (see above)
3. Update this README with a new section
4. Add cross-references in `dependencies.md` if applicable
5. Create supporting documentation in `docs/planning/`
