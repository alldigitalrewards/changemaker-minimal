# Critical Fixes Summary - Phase 2 Gate Check

## Completion Date: 2025-10-27

## Issue 1: Points Award Bypass Bug (FIXED)
**Location**: `/Users/jack/Projects/changemaker-template/lib/db/queries.ts` lines 3000-3021

**Problem**: The `managerReviewSubmission` function was directly updating PointsBalance when a manager approved a submission, bypassing the budget system and creating data inconsistency.

**Fix Applied**: Removed lines 3000-3021 that awarded points during manager approval. Added a comment explaining that points are awarded ONLY during final admin approval to ensure proper budget tracking and consistency.

**Code Change**:
```typescript
// BEFORE (Lines 3000-3021 - REMOVED):
// If manager approved, award points
if (data.status === 'MANAGER_APPROVED' && data.pointsAwarded && data.pointsAwarded > 0) {
  await prisma.pointsBalance.upsert({
    where: {
      userId_workspaceId: {
        userId: submission.userId,
        workspaceId: data.workspaceId
      }
    },
    create: {
      id: crypto.randomUUID(),
      userId: submission.userId,
      workspaceId: data.workspaceId,
      totalPoints: data.pointsAwarded,
      availablePoints: data.pointsAwarded
    },
    update: {
      totalPoints: { increment: data.pointsAwarded },
      availablePoints: { increment: data.pointsAwarded }
    }
  })
}

// AFTER:
// Points are awarded ONLY during final admin approval, not manager approval
// This ensures proper budget tracking and consistency
```

## Issue 2: Test Schema Mismatches (FIXED)

### File: `/Users/jack/Projects/changemaker-template/tests/api/manager-auth.spec.ts`

**Problems Fixed**:
1. Used `sortOrder` instead of `position` when creating Activity records
2. Missing required fields for Activity creation (`id`, `templateId`, `pointsValue`)
3. Missing enrollmentId when creating ActivitySubmission
4. Using wrong enum value 'ACTIVE' instead of 'ENROLLED' for enrollment status
5. Missing required fields for Challenge creation

**Changes Applied**:
- Line 108: Changed `activityTemplateId` to `templateId`, added `id`, `pointsValue`, `position`
- Line 113: Added enrollment creation before submission
- Line 123: Added `enrollmentId` to submission creation
- Line 213: Fixed enrollment status from 'ACTIVE' to 'ENROLLED' (via sed command)
- Lines 200-206: Fixed unassigned activity creation with proper schema fields
- Lines 209-215: Added enrollment for unassigned challenge submissions

### File: `/Users/jack/Projects/changemaker-template/tests/api/manager-workflow.spec.ts`

**Problems Fixed**:
1. Referenced non-existent `User.points` field (User model doesn't have points field)
2. Used `sortOrder` instead of `position` 
3. Missing `enrollmentId` in submission creation
4. Wrong enum value for enrollment status
5. Wrong case for rewardType enum

**Changes Applied**:
- All references to `User.points` replaced with proper PointsBalance table queries
- Lines 229-238: Query PointsBalance instead of User.points
- Lines 260-269: Query PointsBalance for verification
- Lines 274-296: Proper cleanup using PointsBalance table
- Line 102: Changed to `position: 0`
- Line 112: Fixed enrollment status from 'ACTIVE' to 'ENROLLED'
- Line 65: Fixed rewardType from 'POINTS' to 'points' (lowercase enum value)
- Line 115: Added enrollmentId variable
- All submission creations now include enrollmentId field

**Correct Pattern for Points**:
```typescript
// Query points before
const pointsBalanceBefore = await prisma.pointsBalance.findUnique({
  where: {
    userId_workspaceId: {
      userId: participantId,
      workspaceId
    }
  }
});
const pointsBefore = pointsBalanceBefore?.totalPoints || 0;

// Query points after
const pointsBalanceAfter = await prisma.pointsBalance.findUnique({
  where: {
    userId_workspaceId: {
      userId: participantId,
      workspaceId
    }
  }
});
const pointsAfter = pointsBalanceAfter?.totalPoints || 0;

// Cleanup
if (pointsBalanceBefore) {
  await prisma.pointsBalance.update({
    where: {
      userId_workspaceId: {
        userId: participantId,
        workspaceId
      }
    },
    data: {
      totalPoints: pointsBefore,
      availablePoints: pointsBefore
    }
  });
}
```

## Schema Reference (from prisma/schema.prisma)

### Activity Model (lines 11-31)
- Field name is `position` NOT `sortOrder` (line 21)
- Required fields: id, templateId, challengeId, pointsValue

### ActivitySubmission Model (lines 55-84)
- Required fields: id, activityId, userId, enrollmentId
- User.points field DOES NOT EXIST - use PointsBalance table instead

### EnrollmentStatus Enum (lines 530-534)
- Valid values: INVITED, ENROLLED, WITHDRAWN
- NOT 'ACTIVE' - that value doesn't exist in schema

### RewardType Enum (lines 543-547)
- Valid values: points, sku, monetary (lowercase)
- NOT 'POINTS' (uppercase)

## Test Status

After fixes applied:
- ✅ No Prisma validation errors
- ✅ All schema field references corrected
- ✅ Points tracking now uses correct PointsBalance table
- ⚠️  Tests timing out due to authentication issues (separate from schema fixes)

## Impact

These critical fixes ensure:
1. **Data Integrity**: Points are only awarded through the proper admin approval flow with budget tracking
2. **Schema Compliance**: All test code matches the actual Prisma schema
3. **Correct Relationships**: ActivitySubmissions properly link to Enrollments
4. **Type Safety**: All enum values match schema definitions

## Next Steps

The critical blocking issues for Gate 2 passage are resolved. The test timeouts appear to be environment/authentication related and should be addressed separately from these schema correctness fixes.
