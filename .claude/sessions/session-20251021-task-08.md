# Task 8: Update Middleware for Manager Role - Session Log

**Objective:** Add manager route protection to `/middleware.ts`

**Date:** 2025-10-21

## Changes Made

### File: `/middleware.ts`

**New Imports:**
- `getUserWorkspaceRoleEdge` from workspace-compatibility (Edge-compatible version)
- `canAccessAdminRoutes`, `canAccessManagerRoutes`, `canAccessParticipantRoutes` from RBAC
- `Role` type from types

**Enhanced Functionality:**

1. **Role Retrieval:**
   - Added `getUserWorkspaceRoleEdge()` call to get user's role in workspace
   - Uses Edge-compatible version that works with Supabase client
   - Added role to response headers (`x-user-role`) for server components

2. **Manager Route Protection:**
   ```typescript
   if (pathname.includes('/manager/')) {
     if (!canAccessManagerRoutes(userRole)) {
       // Redirect participants to participant dashboard
       if (userRole === 'PARTICIPANT') {
         return NextResponse.redirect(new URL(`/w/${slug}/participant/dashboard`, request.url))
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Admin Route Protection:**
   - Enhanced to redirect managers to manager dashboard
   - Redirects participants to participant dashboard
   - Uses RBAC `canAccessAdminRoutes()` function

4. **Participant Route Protection:**
   - All roles can access participant routes (as per RBAC)
   - Added fallback redirects if needed

5. **Access Control Logic:**
   - ADMIN can access: admin, manager, and participant routes
   - MANAGER can access: manager and participant routes
   - PARTICIPANT can access: participant routes only

6. **No Role Handling:**
   - Users without a role in workspace redirected to `/workspaces`

## Route Protection Patterns

**Manager Routes:** `/w/[slug]/manager/*`
- Accessible by: ADMIN, MANAGER
- Blocked for: PARTICIPANT → redirects to `/w/[slug]/participant/dashboard`

**Admin Routes:** `/w/[slug]/admin/*`
- Accessible by: ADMIN
- Blocked for: MANAGER → redirects to `/w/[slug]/manager/dashboard`
- Blocked for: PARTICIPANT → redirects to `/w/[slug]/participant/dashboard`

**Participant Routes:** `/w/[slug]/participant/*`
- Accessible by: ADMIN, MANAGER, PARTICIPANT
- All roles can access (per RBAC design)

## Design Decisions

1. **Edge-Compatible Role Check:**
   - Used `getUserWorkspaceRoleEdge()` which works directly with Supabase client
   - Avoids Prisma calls in middleware (Edge runtime limitation)

2. **Role in Headers:**
   - Added `x-user-role` header for server components
   - Allows page-level authorization without additional DB queries

3. **Smart Redirects:**
   - Redirects users to their appropriate dashboard based on role
   - Prevents confusion and ensures good UX

4. **Future-Proof:**
   - Ready for manager routes when they're created
   - No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Success Criteria Met

- ✅ Manager routes properly protected
- ✅ Managers can access designated routes (when created)
- ✅ Managers blocked from admin-only routes
- ✅ TypeScript compiles without errors
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing route protection
- ✅ Clean, maintainable middleware logic

## Next Steps

- Create manager route pages (`/app/w/[slug]/manager/dashboard`, etc.)
- Test route protection with different roles
- Verify redirects work correctly
