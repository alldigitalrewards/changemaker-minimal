# Manager Role Implementation - Complete Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Feature:** Add MANAGER role to the Changemaker platform
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for preview deployment testing

---

## Overview

Successfully implemented the MANAGER role feature across all layers of the application, from database schema to middleware protection. This provides a middle-tier role between ADMIN and PARTICIPANT with specific permissions for managing challenges and reviewing submissions.

---

## Completed Tasks (1-8)

### ✅ Task 1: Schema Design
**File:** `docs/manager-role-schema-design.md`

Designed the database schema for the MANAGER role including:
- Updated WorkspaceMembership to support MANAGER role
- Created ChallengeAssignment junction table for manager-to-challenge assignments
- Planned permission model: workspace view, challenge edit, submission review

### ✅ Task 2: Migration Generation
**File:** `prisma/migrations/20251021_add_manager_role/migration.sql`

Generated SQL migration with:
- ALTER TYPE to add MANAGER to Role enum
- CREATE TABLE for ChallengeAssignment with proper indexes
- Foreign key constraints and cascade rules
- Default values and metadata columns

### ✅ Task 3: Staging Migration Testing
**Database:** Staging Supabase (`jlvvtejfinfqjfulnmfl`)

Successfully applied migration to staging:
- Migration executed without errors
- Verified schema changes in Supabase dashboard
- Confirmed Role enum includes MANAGER
- Validated ChallengeAssignment table structure
- Verified indexes and constraints

### ✅ Task 4: Prisma Types and RBAC Updates
**Files:**
- `lib/types.ts`
- `lib/auth/rbac.ts`
- `prisma/schema.prisma`

**Changes:**
1. Updated Prisma schema with ChallengeAssignment model
2. Added MANAGER to Role type definition
3. Updated RBAC permissions:
   - MANAGER permissions: workspace view, challenge view/edit, submission review
   - Added route access functions: `canAccessManagerRoutes()`, `isManager()`
   - Added path-based access control for manager routes
4. Generated Prisma client with new types

### ✅ Task 5: Database Query Helpers
**File:** `lib/db/queries.ts`

Added manager-specific query functions:
1. `getChallengeAssignments(workspaceId, managerId?)` - Get assignments
2. `assignManagerToChallenge(...)` - Assign manager to challenge
3. `removeManagerFromChallenge(...)` - Remove assignment
4. `getManagerChallenges(managerId, workspaceId)` - Get assigned challenges
5. `getManagerPendingSubmissions(...)` - Get submissions for review

All functions include:
- Workspace isolation
- Role verification
- Proper error handling
- TypeScript type safety

### ✅ Task 6: RBAC System (Part of Task 4)
**File:** `lib/auth/rbac.ts`

Completed as part of Task 4. RBAC fully supports:
- MANAGER role detection: `isManager(userRole)`
- Route access control: `canAccessManagerRoutes(userRole)`
- Permission checking: `hasPermission(userRole, PERMISSIONS.SUBMISSION_REVIEW)`
- Path generation: `getAccessiblePaths(userRole, workspaceSlug)`

### ✅ Task 7: Update Workspace Context
**File:** `lib/workspace-context.ts`

Enhanced workspace context with manager support:

**New Functions:**
1. `isWorkspaceManager(userId, workspaceId)` - Check if user is manager
2. `getManagerAssignedChallenges(managerId, workspaceId)` - Get assigned challenges

**Enhancements:**
- Re-exported Role type for convenience
- Updated documentation
- Added proper TypeScript types
- Uses WorkspaceMembership for role verification

### ✅ Task 8: Update Middleware for Manager Role
**File:** `middleware.ts`

Implemented role-based route protection:

**Features:**
1. **Role Retrieval:**
   - Uses `getUserWorkspaceRoleEdge()` for Edge runtime compatibility
   - Adds `x-user-role` header for server components

2. **Manager Route Protection:**
   - Routes: `/w/[slug]/manager/*`
   - Accessible by: ADMIN, MANAGER
   - Blocks: PARTICIPANT → redirects to participant dashboard

3. **Admin Route Protection:**
   - Routes: `/w/[slug]/admin/*`
   - Accessible by: ADMIN only
   - Blocks: MANAGER → redirects to manager dashboard
   - Blocks: PARTICIPANT → redirects to participant dashboard

4. **Participant Route Protection:**
   - Routes: `/w/[slug]/participant/*`
   - Accessible by: All roles (ADMIN, MANAGER, PARTICIPANT)

5. **Smart Redirects:**
   - Users redirected to appropriate dashboard based on role
   - No role in workspace → redirects to `/workspaces`

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. ChallengeAssignment Junction Table
- Enables flexible assignment of managers to specific challenges
- Supports future features like assignment history
- Allows multiple managers per challenge
- Proper cascade deletes to maintain data integrity

### 2. Role Hierarchy
```
ADMIN
  ├─ Full workspace control
  ├─ Can access all routes (admin, manager, participant)
  └─ Can manage users and workspace settings

MANAGER
  ├─ Assigned to specific challenges
  ├─ Can edit assigned challenges
  ├─ Can review submissions
  ├─ Can access manager and participant routes
  └─ Cannot manage workspace or users

PARTICIPANT
  ├─ Can join challenges
  ├─ Can submit activities
  ├─ Can view own progress
  └─ Can only access participant routes
```

### 3. Middleware Protection Strategy
- Edge-compatible role checking using Supabase directly
- Role passed via headers to avoid redundant DB queries
- Smart redirects based on user role
- Future-proof for when manager routes are created

### 4. MVP Scope Decisions
- Manager query functions are ready
- Middleware protection is in place
- Manager routes UI not yet created (future task)
- Database supports flexible assignment system

---

## Testing Completed

### ✅ TypeScript Compilation
```bash
pnpm tsc --noEmit
# Result: ✅ No errors in manager-related code
```

### ✅ Production Build
```bash
pnpm build
# Result: ✅ Build successful, middleware compiled to 89.8 kB
```

### ✅ Database Migration
- Applied to staging Supabase
- Verified schema changes
- Confirmed no data corruption

### ✅ Type Safety
- All functions properly typed
- Prisma types generated correctly
- RBAC functions type-safe

---

## Next Steps for Preview Deployment

### Immediate (Before Deploy)
1. ✅ Run full type check - COMPLETE
2. ✅ Run production build - COMPLETE
3. ✅ Verify migration on staging - COMPLETE

### Post-Deploy Verification
1. **Test Migration on Production:**
   ```bash
   # Apply migration to production Supabase
   pnpm prisma migrate deploy
   ```

2. **Test Role-Based Access:**
   - Create test manager user
   - Verify middleware redirects
   - Test route protection

3. **Verify Database Queries:**
   - Test `getManagerChallenges()`
   - Test `assignManagerToChallenge()`
   - Verify workspace isolation

### Future Implementation
1. **Create Manager Routes:**
   - `/w/[slug]/manager/dashboard` - Manager dashboard
   - `/w/[slug]/manager/challenges` - Assigned challenges list
   - `/w/[slug]/manager/submissions` - Submission review interface

2. **Admin UI Updates:**
   - Add manager assignment UI in challenge edit page
   - Add manager management in user admin
   - Display assigned managers on challenge pages

3. **Manager Dashboard Features:**
   - List assigned challenges
   - View pending submissions
   - Quick stats and metrics

---

## Known Limitations (MVP Scope)

1. **No Manager UI Yet:**
   - Manager routes don't exist yet (protected in middleware but not created)
   - Will be built in next iteration

2. **Assignment UI:**
   - No admin UI for assigning managers to challenges
   - Will be added to challenge edit page

3. **Notifications:**
   - No email notifications for manager assignments
   - Future feature
