# Task 7: Update Workspace Context - Session Log

**Objective:** Add manager-specific helper functions to `/lib/workspace-context.ts`

**Date:** 2025-10-21

## Changes Made

### File: `/lib/workspace-context.ts`

**Additions:**

1. **New Imports:**
   - Added `getChallengesByWorkspace`, `getUserBySupabaseId` from queries
   - Added `getMembership` from workspace-membership
   - Added `type Role, type Challenge` from types

2. **Type Exports:**
   - Re-exported `Role` type for convenience

3. **Enhanced Functions:**
   - Updated `getUserWorkspaceRole()` documentation to clarify it returns ADMIN, MANAGER, or PARTICIPANT

4. **New Helper Functions:**

   a. `isWorkspaceManager(userId: string, workspaceId: string): Promise<boolean>`
      - Checks if user has MANAGER role in workspace
      - Uses WorkspaceMembership table for verification
      - Includes error handling

   b. `getManagerAssignedChallenges(managerId: string, workspaceId: string): Promise<Challenge[]>`
      - Returns challenges assigned to a manager
      - Currently returns all workspace challenges (MVP scope)
      - Validates user is actually a manager
      - Includes TODO for future ChallengeManager junction table

## Design Decisions

1. **MVP Scope:** Managers see all challenges in their workspace
   - Future enhancement: Add ChallengeManager junction table for specific assignments
   - Documented with TODO comment for tracking

2. **Type Safety:**
   - All functions properly typed with TypeScript
   - Re-export Role type to make it available to consumers

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Try/catch blocks in all async functions
   - Console logging for debugging
   - Safe fallback to empty arrays/false

## Success Criteria Met

- ✅ `getUserWorkspaceRole()` correctly returns MANAGER when appropriate
- ✅ New manager helper functions available
- ✅ TypeScript types properly exported
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Clean, documented code
