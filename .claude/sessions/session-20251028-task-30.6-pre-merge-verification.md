# Session: Task 30.6 - Pre-Merge Verification & Integration Testing

**Date**: 2025-10-28 15:08:16 MST
**Task ID**: Task 30.6 from Phase 2 (RLS Security)
**Estimated Time**: 2 hours
**Session Type**: Critical Gate - Pre-Merge Verification

## Context Files
@.claude/PRE_MERGE_CHECKLIST.md
@.claude/PROGRESS.md (lines 341-356)
@.claude/plans/task-list.md
@tests/security/rls-policies.spec.ts
@docs/security/rls-policies.md

## Task Summary

Complete comprehensive pre-merge verification to ensure Manager Role Phase 2 + RLS policies are production-ready without breaking existing functionality.

**Dependencies**: Task 30.4 (RLS Testing) âœ… COMPLETE
**Blocks**: Merge to staging, Phase 3 (RewardSTACK Integration)
**Risk Level**: ðŸ”´ CRITICAL - Gate 2 decision point

## Verification Scope

### Phase 2 Manager API Endpoints to Verify
1. **Manager Assignment CRUD**:
   - `POST /api/workspaces/[slug]/challenges/[id]/managers` - Create assignment
   - `GET /api/workspaces/[slug]/challenges/[id]/managers` - List managers
   - `DELETE /api/workspaces/[slug]/challenges/[id]/managers/[managerId]` - Remove assignment

2. **Manager Queue & Review**:
   - `GET /api/workspaces/[slug]/manager/queue` - Get assigned submissions
   - `POST /api/workspaces/[slug]/submissions/[id]/manager-review` - Approve/reject

3. **Admin Override**:
   - `POST /api/workspaces/[slug]/submissions/[id]/review` - Admin final approval

### RLS Verification Required
- âœ… 22 RLS security tests passing (100% success rate from Task 30.4)
- Workspace isolation at database level
- Manager can ONLY access assigned challenges
- Admin override permissions preserved
- Cross-workspace access blocked
- Service role bypass working

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: API Endpoint Verification with RLS Active (30 min)

Create comprehensive API verification test that:
1. Sets up test fixtures (workspaces, users, challenges, assignments)
2. Tests each endpoint with proper auth contexts
3. Verifies RLS policies enforce expected behavior
4. Tests negative cases (unauthorized access)

**Test Structure**:
```typescript
// tests/integration/phase2-api-verification.spec.ts
describe('Phase 2 API Verification with RLS', () => {
  describe('Manager Assignment CRUD', () => {
    test('Admin can assign manager to challenge');
    test('Admin can list assigned managers');
    test('Admin can remove manager assignment');
    test('Manager cannot assign themselves');
    test('Cross-workspace assignment blocked');
  });

  describe('Manager Queue & Review', () => {
    test('Manager sees only assigned challenge submissions');
    test('Manager can approve assigned submission');
    test('Manager cannot see unassigned submissions');
    test('Cross-workspace queue access blocked');
  });

  describe('Admin Override', () => {
    test('Admin can approve MANAGER_APPROVED submission');
    test('Admin can reject MANAGER_APPROVED submission');
    test('Admin override tracked in ActivityEvent');
  });
});
```

### Step 2: End-to-End Manager Workflow Test (20 min)

Create full workflow test:
```typescript
// tests/integration/manager-workflow-e2e.spec.ts
test('Complete manager workflow: Assignment â†’ Review â†’ Approval', async () => {
  // 1. Admin creates challenge
  // 2. Admin assigns manager to challenge
  // 3. Participant enrolls and submits
  // 4. Manager sees submission in queue
  // 5. Manager approves (PENDING â†’ MANAGER_APPROVED)
  // 6. Admin sees in queue
  // 7. Admin approves (MANAGER_APPROVED â†’ APPROVED)
  // 8. Points awarded
  // 9. Verify workspace isolation throughout
});
```

### Step 3: Performance Verification (15 min)

Test manager queue performance with RLS enabled:
```typescript
// tests/performance/manager-queue-performance.spec.ts
test('Manager queue loads <2s with 100 submissions', async () => {
  // Create 100 submissions across 10 challenges
  // Assign manager to all 10 challenges
  // Time the queue API call
  // Verify response time <2000ms
  // Check EXPLAIN ANALYZE shows index usage
});
```

### Step 4: Breaking Changes Check (20 min)

Verify Phase 1 functionality still works:
```bash
# Run existing test suites
pnpm test tests/api/challenge-crud.spec.ts  # Challenge CRUD
pnpm test tests/api/participants.spec.ts    # Participant enrollment
pnpm test tests/api/submissions.spec.ts     # Submissions (if exists)

# Verify no regressions in:
# - Challenge creation/management
# - Participant enrollment
# - Activity submissions
# - Admin approval (without manager)
# - Points system
```

### Step 5: Full Test Suite Execution (10 min)

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Expected results:
# - Unit tests: All passing
# - Integration tests: All passing
# - RLS security tests: 22/22 passing (verified in Task 30.4)
# - Authorization tests: All passing
# - No test failures
# - Coverage >90%
```

### Step 6: Documentation & Progress Update (15 min)

1. Update `.claude/PROGRESS.md`:
   - Mark Task 30.6 complete
   - Update Gate 2 criteria checklist
   - Document test results

2. Update `.claude/PRE_MERGE_CHECKLIST.md`:
   - Check off completed verification items
   - Document any issues found
   - Record performance metrics

3. Review session files:
   - Verify all Task 16-30 sessions exist
   - Check for missing documentation

### Step 7: Create Merge PR (10 min)

Draft comprehensive PR description:
```markdown

**Risk 2**: Performance degradation with RLS enabled
- **Likelihood**: Medium (RLS adds query overhead)
- **Impact**: Medium (affects user experience)
- **Mitigation**: Performance tests + index verification

**Risk 3**: Breaking changes to Phase 1 functionality
- **Likelihood**: Low (additive changes only)
- **Impact**: Critical (production issues)
- **Mitigation**: Run full existing test suite

**Risk 4**: Missing edge cases in verification
- **Likelihood**: Medium (complex system)
- **Impact**: Medium (issues found in staging)
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test coverage + manual testing
