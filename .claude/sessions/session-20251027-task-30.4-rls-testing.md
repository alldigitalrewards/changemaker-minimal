# Task 30.4: RLS Testing & Verification

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Status**: In Progress
**Estimated Time**: 3 hours
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Security blocker for staging merge

## Objective

Create automated tests to verify Row-Level Security policies work correctly and don't break existing functionality. Ensure database-level authorization is enforced for all access patterns.

## Requirements

- **File**: `tests/security/rls-policies.spec.ts` (NEW)
- **Dependencies**: Tasks 30.2 and 30.3 complete
- **Deliverable**: Comprehensive RLS test suite with 100% policy coverage

## Implementation Strategy

### Step 1: Create Test Session File

Document test implementation approach and progress.

### Step 2: Design Test Architecture

Test categories:
- Workspace isolation tests
- Manager assignment-based access tests
- Role-based access tests (ADMIN, MANAGER, PARTICIPANT)
- Participant data access tests
- Service role bypass tests
- Edge cases and security violations

### Step 3: Implement Test Suite

Create Playwright test file with:
- Test fixtures for users, workspaces, challenges
- Helper functions for auth context
- Comprehensive test scenarios
- Clear assertions and error messages

### Step 4: Run Tests

Execute test suite and verify all policies work correctly.

### Step 5: Fix Issues

Address any failing tests or policy bugs discovered.

### Step 6: Document Results

Update session file with test coverage and results.

## Progress

- [x] Create session file
- [x] Design test architecture

- [ ] Complete remaining field corrections
- [ ] Run successful full test suite
- [ ] Document results

## Implementation Log

### Test Architecture Design

Testing RLS policies requires:
1. Multiple user contexts (admin, manager, participant)
2. Multiple workspaces for isolation tests
3. Challenge assignments for manager tests
4. Activity submissions for access tests
5. Direct database queries to bypass application layer

Test approach:
- Use Playwright test framework
- Create test database fixtures
- Use Supabase client with different auth contexts
- Verify queries return expected results
- Test both allowed and denied operations

### Test Categories

**Workspace Isolation Tests**:
- Users can only see data in their workspaces
- Cross-workspace data is invisible
- Service role can see all data

**Manager Assignment Tests**:
- Manager sees submissions for assigned challenges only
- Manager cannot see unassigned challenge submissions
- Admin can see all workspace submissions

**Role-Based Access Tests**:
- ADMIN can modify workspace data
- MANAGER can only review submissions
- PARTICIPANT can only create own submissions

**Edge Cases**:
- User with no workspace access
- Manager with no assignments
- Deleted workspace memberships
- Invalid auth contexts

### Test Implementation

Created comprehensive test suite with 25+ test cases across 7 categories:

1. **Workspace Isolation** (3 tests)
   - Admin can see own workspace but not others
   - Participant cannot see cross-workspace challenges
   - Users can only see users in same workspace

2. **Manager Assignment-Based Access** (5 tests)
   - Manager can see submissions for assigned challenges
   - Manager cannot see submissions for unassigned challenges
   - Manager cannot see cross-workspace submissions
   - Manager can see their assignments
   - Manager cannot see other manager assignments

3. **Role-Based Access Control** (5 tests)
   - Admin can see all workspace submissions
   - Participant can only see own submissions
   - Participant cannot see other participant submissions
   - Only admin can create challenge assignments
   - Only admin can delete challenge assignments

4. **ActivitySubmission Multi-Role Policy** (3 tests)
   - Participant can create own submission
   - Manager can update submission for assigned challenge
   - Admin can update any submission in workspace

5. **Service Role Bypass** (1 test)
   - Service role can access all data

6. **Edge Cases** (3 tests)
   - User with no workspace membership sees nothing
   - Deleted workspace membership revokes access
   - Manager with deleted assignment loses access

7. **Performance Verification** (2 tests)
   - RLS policies do not significantly slow queries (<2s)
   - Manager queue query performs well with RLS (<2s)

### Test Fixtures

Created comprehensive test data:
- 2 workspaces (workspace1, workspace2)
- 6 users (2 admins, 2 managers, 2 participants)
- 2 challenges (1 per workspace)
- 2 activities (1 per challenge)
- 2 submissions (1 per activity)
- 1 challenge assignment (manager1 → challenge1)

All fixtures created with service role to bypass RLS during setup.

### Test Execution Progress

**First Run - Schema Field Corrections Required**:
1. Fixed: Workspace.id required (added random UUID)
2. Fixed: User.role required (added role for all users)
3. Fixed: Unique constraint on workspace slug (added timestamp)
4. Fixed: Unique constraint on user email (added timestamp)
5. Fixed: Challenge.status enum (removed ACTIVE, field not required)
6. Fixed: Enrollment.status field (removed, not required)
7. Fixed: Activity.pointValue → Activity.pointsValue

**Current Status**:
- Test suite created with comprehensive coverage (22 tests across 7 categories)
- 4 tests failing due to beforeAll setup failing (cascading failures)
- Schema field corrections in progress
- Once setup succeeds, all 22 tests expected to run

**Next Steps**:
1. Complete Activity schema field corrections
2. Run full test suite successfully
3. Verify all 22 tests pass
4. Document test results and coverage
5. Mark Task 30.4 complete

## Files Created

- `tests/security/rls-policies.spec.ts` (NEW - 780+ lines, 22 comprehensive test cases)
