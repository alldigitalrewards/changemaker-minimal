## Investigation Results

### Schema Indexes (prisma/schema.prisma)
```prisma
model ChallengeAssignment {
  @@unique([challengeId, managerId])
  @@index([managerId, workspaceId])
  @@index([challengeId])
  @@index([workspaceId])
}
```

### Database Indexes (Verified)
```
✅ ChallengeAssignment_pkey (PRIMARY KEY, btree on id)
✅ ChallengeAssignment_challengeId_managerId_key (UNIQUE, btree)
✅ ChallengeAssignment_managerId_workspaceId_idx (btree)
✅ ChallengeAssignment_challengeId_idx (btree)
✅ ChallengeAssignment_workspaceId_idx (btree)
```

### Query Performance Tests

**Test 1: Manager Queue Query (managerId + workspaceId)**
- Index Used: `ChallengeAssignment_managerId_workspaceId_idx`
- Execution Time: 0.129 ms ✅
- Result: EXCELLENT - Composite index working perfectly

**Test 2: Find Managers for Challenge (challengeId)**
- Index Used: `ChallengeAssignment_challengeId_managerId_key` (unique constraint used as index)
- Execution Time: 0.174 ms ✅
- Result: EXCELLENT - Using unique constraint as index

**Test 3: Check Manager Assignment (challengeId + managerId)**
- Index Used: `ChallengeAssignment_challengeId_managerId_key` (Index Only Scan)
- Execution Time: 0.241 ms ✅
- Result: EXCELLENT - Index-only scan, most efficient

### Analysis

All required indexes are present and working optimally:

1. ✅ **managerId + workspaceId (composite)** - Perfect for manager queue queries
2. ✅ **challengeId** - Standalone index for finding managers
3. ✅ **challengeId + managerId (unique)** - Double duty as constraint and index

Additional indexes found:
4. ✅ **workspaceId** - Good for workspace-level queries

### Performance Characteristics

- All queries execute in < 1ms
- Proper index usage confirmed via EXPLAIN ANALYZE
- No sequential scans on ChallengeAssignment table
- Index-only scans being used where possible (optimal)

### Recommendations

**No changes needed.** Current index configuration is optimal:
- Covers all query patterns from Task 10
- Execution times well below acceptable thresholds
- No missing indexes identified
- Query planner selecting optimal indexes automatically

## Task Complete

✅ Verified all required indexes exist
✅ Tested query performance with EXPLAIN ANALYZE
✅ All queries < 1ms execution time
✅ No slow queries at current scale
✅ No additional indexes needed

Risk: Minimal - indexes are properly configured for expected query patterns.
