## Implementation Complete

Added manager users to prisma/seed.ts:

1. Created `managerUsers` array with 3 managers:
   - sarah.manager@acme.com â†’ ACME workspace
   - tom.manager@alldigitalrewards.com â†’ AllDigitalRewards workspace
   - lisa.manager@sharecare.com â†’ Sharecare workspace

2. Implementation details:
   - User.role set to PARTICIPANT (legacy compatibility as per task requirements)
   - WorkspaceMembership.role set to MANAGER (actual role)
   - Each manager assigned to exactly one workspace with isPrimary=true
   - Integrated into seed script between admin and participant user creation

3. Updated login credentials output to include manager accounts

## Testing

Seed script executed successfully. Verifying manager users in database...

## Verification

Seed script executed successfully with output:
```
ðŸ‘” Creating manager users...
âœ“ Created manager: sarah.manager@acme.com (workspace: acme)
âœ“ Created manager: tom.manager@alldigitalrewards.com (workspace: alldigitalrewards)
âœ“ Created manager: lisa.manager@sharecare.com (workspace: sharecare)
```

Summary shows:
- Users: 16 (4 admins, 9 participants) - Note: 3 managers counted separately
- Workspace Memberships: 20 (includes manager memberships)

Database verification confirms all 3 manager users created with:
- User.role = PARTICIPANT (legacy compatibility)
- WorkspaceMembership.role = MANAGER (actual role)

## Task Complete

Task 9 deliverables met:
âœ… Added managerUsers array to prisma/seed.ts
âœ… Created 3 manager users (1 per workspace)
âœ… Created WorkspaceMembership records with MANAGER role
âœ… Kept User.role as PARTICIPANT (legacy compatibility)
âœ… Updated login credentials output

Risk mitigation:
- No conflicts with existing data (clean seed)
- Manager users properly isolated to single workspaces
- Legacy field maintained for backward compatibility
