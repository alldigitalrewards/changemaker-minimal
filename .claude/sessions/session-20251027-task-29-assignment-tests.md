# Task 29: Assignment Tests

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Status**: In Progress
**Estimated Time**: 2 hours
**Priority**: HIGH - Testing manager assignment CRUD operations

## Objective

Create comprehensive tests for challenge assignment operations to ensure proper CRUD functionality and cross-workspace isolation.

## Requirements

- **File**: `tests/api/challenge-assignments.spec.ts` (NEW)
- **Dependencies**: Tasks 16 (List Assignments API), 17 (Assign/Unassign Manager API)
- **Test Coverage**:
  - Create assignment (assign manager to challenge)
  - List assignments for a challenge
  - Remove assignment (unassign manager from challenge)
  - Cannot assign manager from different workspace
  - Cannot assign non-manager role to challenge
  - Duplicate assignment prevention
  - Cross-workspace isolation validation

## Implementation Strategy

### Step 1: Review Assignment APIs
- Review Tasks 16 and 17 API implementations
- Check assignment routes and authorization
- Review ChallengeAssignment model in Prisma schema
- Understand workspace isolation requirements

### Step 2: Create Test File Structure
- Set up Playwright test file
- Import necessary helpers and types
- Define test data (challenges, managers, workspaces)
- Set up beforeAll/afterAll hooks

### Step 3: Implement Test Cases
1. Admin can assign manager to challenge
2. Admin can list managers assigned to challenge
3. Admin can unassign manager from challenge
4. Cannot assign manager from different workspace (400)
5. Cannot assign PARTICIPANT role as manager (400)
6. Cannot create duplicate assignment
7. Cross-workspace isolation (cannot see other workspace assignments)
8. PARTICIPANT cannot access assignment endpoints (403)

### Step 4: Run Tests & Verify
- Run test suite
- Fix any failing tests
- Verify proper cleanup
- Ensure workspace isolation
