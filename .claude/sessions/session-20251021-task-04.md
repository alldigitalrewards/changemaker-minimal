# Session: Task 4 - Update Prisma Schema Types

**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Task:** Regenerate Prisma client with new schema types
**Status:** In Progress

## Objective
Generate Prisma client with new MANAGER role and submission status types, verify TypeScript compilation.

## Requirements
1. Regenerate Prisma client with new schema types
2. Verify TypeScript compilation succeeds
3. Check that new types are available (Role.MANAGER, SubmissionStatus.MANAGER_APPROVED, etc.)
4. Update any type imports if needed

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Regenerate Prisma Client
```bash
pnpm prisma generate
```

### Step 2: Verify TypeScript Compilation
```bash
pnpm tsc --noEmit
```

### Step 3: Check Generated Types
Verify in `node_modules/.prisma/client` that new enum values exist:
- Role.MANAGER
- SubmissionStatus.MANAGER_APPROVED
- SubmissionStatus.NEEDS_REVISION

### Step 4: Commit Changes
If successful, commit with appropriate message.

## Progress Log

### Step 1: Regenerate Prisma Client ✅
```bash
pnpm prisma generate
```
- Generated successfully with new MANAGER role and submission statuses
- Verified runtime enums include:
  - Role: ADMIN, PARTICIPANT, MANAGER
  - SubmissionStatus: PENDING, MANAGER_APPROVED, NEEDS_REVISION, APPROVED, REJECTED, DRAFT

### Step 2: Update TypeScript Type Definitions ✅
Updated `/lib/types.ts`:
- Added 'MANAGER' to Role type
- Added ROLE_MANAGER constant
- Updated SubmissionStatus to include 'MANAGER_APPROVED' | 'NEEDS_REVISION'
- Updated USER_ROLES constant array
- Updated SUBMISSION_STATUSES constant array
- Added isManager() type guard function

### Step 3: Update Component Prop Types ✅
Updated component interfaces to use Role type from lib/types:
- `/components/layout/dashboard-header.tsx`: DashboardHeaderProps.role now uses Role type
- `/components/workspaces/workspaces-sidebar.tsx`: WorkspaceMembership.role and WorkspacesSidebarProps.userRole now use Role type

### Step 4: Update RBAC System ✅
Updated `/lib/auth/rbac.ts`:
- Added MANAGER to ROLES constant
- Added submission permissions: SUBMISSION_REVIEW, SUBMISSION_VIEW
- Defined MANAGER permissions in ROLE_PERMISSIONS mapping:
  - Can view workspace
  - Can view and edit challenges (assigned ones)
  - Can view users
  - Can view enrollments
  - Can review and view submissions
- Added isManager() helper function
- Added canAccessManagerRoutes() function
- Updated canAccessParticipantRoutes() to include managers
- Updated getAccessiblePaths() to include manager-specific routes

### Step 5: Verify TypeScript Compilation ✅
```bash
pnpm tsc --noEmit
```
- Only 2 unrelated errors in test file about missing 'segment' properties
- All manager role types compile successfully
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Success Criteria Checklist
- [x] Prisma client regenerated without errors
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes (except unrelated test errors)
- [x] New enum values available in types (Role.MANAGER, SubmissionStatus.MANAGER_APPROVED, SubmissionStatus.NEEDS_REVISION)
- [x] Type imports updated in components
- [x] RBAC system recognizes MANAGER role with appropriate permissions

## Decisions Made
1. Managers have submission review permissions but cannot create/delete challenges
2. Managers can access both manager and participant routes (via canAccessParticipantRoutes)
3. Manager routes follow pattern: /w/[slug]/manager/*
4. Permission hierarchy: Admin > Manager > Participant

## Next Steps
Proceed to Task 5: Update Database Query Helpers
