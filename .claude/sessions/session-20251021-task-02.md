# Session: Task 2 - Manager Role Migration Generation

**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Branch:** feature/manager-role-schema
**Task:** Generate Prisma migration for manager role schema changes
**Agent:** claude-code (implementation specialist)

## Session Context

**Previous Work:**
- Task 1 completed: Schema design and modifications committed (6664deb)
- Schema changes include: MANAGER role, ChallengeAssignment model, extended SubmissionStatus, manager review fields

**Current Task:**
Generate and validate Prisma migration file for all schema changes.

## Implementation Log

### Step 1: Pre-Migration Validation
**Time:** [Starting]
**Action:** Verify current schema state and Prisma client generation

**Result:**
- Prisma client generated successfully
- Supabase local instance started
- Git status: clean working tree on feature/manager-role-schema

### Step 2: Migration Generation - Drift Detected
**Time:** [In Progress]
**Issue:** Database drift detected - schema exists but migrations don't

**Analysis:**
The local database has the full schema (including manager role changes) but no migration history.
This is expected for a development database that was pushed with `prisma db push`.

**Decision:**
Need to reset database and create proper migration from scratch to establish migration history.

**Action:** Reset database and generate migration

**Status:** COMPLETED ✅

**Actions Taken:**
1. User provided explicit consent to reset local development database
2. Executed `pnpm prisma migrate reset --skip-seed --force`
3. Successfully re-applied all 8 existing migrations
4. Generated migration SQL using `prisma migrate diff`
5. Created migration file: `20251021092322_add_manager_role_schema/migration.sql`
6. Applied migration successfully with `pnpm prisma migrate deploy`

**Migration File Location:**
`/Users/jack/Projects/changemaker-template/prisma/migrations/20251021092322_add_manager_role_schema/migration.sql`

### Step 3: Migration Validation - COMPLETED ✅

**SQL Review Checklist:**
- [x] ALTER TYPE for Role enum (add MANAGER) ✅
- [x] ALTER TYPE for SubmissionStatus enum (add MANAGER_APPROVED, NEEDS_REVISION) ✅
- [x] CREATE TABLE for ChallengeAssignment with all fields ✅
- [x] ALTER TABLE for ActivitySubmission (managerNotes, managerReviewedAt, managerReviewedBy) ✅
- [x] ALTER TABLE for RewardIssuance (externalTransactionId, externalStatus, externalResponse) ✅
- [x] CREATE INDEX statements for ChallengeAssignment performance ✅
- [x] Proper foreign key constraints ✅

**Database Verification:**
- Role enum: ADMIN, PARTICIPANT, MANAGER ✅
- SubmissionStatus enum: PENDING, APPROVED, REJECTED, DRAFT, MANAGER_APPROVED, NEEDS_REVISION ✅
- ChallengeAssignment table created with:
  - All required columns (id, challengeId, managerId, workspaceId, assignedBy, assignedAt)
  - Primary key on id
  - Unique constraint on (challengeId, managerId)
  - Performance indexes on managerId+workspaceId, challengeId, workspaceId
  - Foreign keys with CASCADE/RESTRICT policies ✅
- ActivitySubmission extended with manager review fields ✅
- RewardIssuance extended with external tracking fields ✅

**Migration Status:**
```
Database schema is up to date!
9 migrations found in prisma/migrations
```

- CommunicationScope and CommunicationAudience enums
- WorkspaceMembershipPreferences table
- WorkspaceCommunication table

Tested: Local development database (127.0.0.1:54322)
Status: All 9 migrations applied successfully
```

## Issues Encountered

### Non-Interactive Environment
**Issue:** `prisma migrate dev` failed in non-interactive environment (Claude Code)
**Solution:** Used `prisma migrate diff` to generate SQL, then manually created migration file
**Outcome:** Successfully created and applied migration

### Database Drift
**Issue:** Database had schema but no migration history
**Solution:** Reset database with user consent, re-applied existing migrations
**Outcome:** Proper migration baseline established
