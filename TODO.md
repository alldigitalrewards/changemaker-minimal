## Feature Requirements Summary

### Challenge Progression and Point System
- **Status**: Planning/Development
- **Key Features**:
  - Challenge progression states (submitted ‚Üí approved ‚Üí in_development ‚Üí in_production ‚Üí verified ‚Üí completed)
  - Activity templates with point values
  - Point awarding upon approval
  - Mock wallet system for testing
  - Future RewardSTACK API integration preparation

### Admin Wallets and Funding System
- **Status**: Planning
- **Key Features**:
  - Workspace-level wallets separate from user wallets
  - Mock funding mechanisms
  - Point distribution controls
  - Budget tracking and analytics
  - Preparation for R.A. (Reporting and Accounting) system integration

### Participant Management Improvements
- **Status**: Planning
- **Key Features**:
  - Advanced filtering and sorting
  - Bulk actions (approve, reject, award points)
  - Quick view modals
  - Activity timeline views
  - Export functionality

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL), Prisma ORM
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components
- **Deployment**: Vercel (changemaker.im production, preview.changemaker.im staging)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Architecture**: Multi-tenant via path-based workspaces (/w/[slug])

## Development Guidelines
- Follow DRY/YAGNI principles
- Maintain MVP focus - no overengineering
- Use adapter patterns for future integrations
- Keep mock systems modular and replaceable
- Ensure backward compatibility during development
- Write tests for critical paths

## Future Considerations
- RewardSTACK API integration (post-MVP)
- Stripe payment integration for reward fulfillment
- Real wallet funding with actual points
- Enterprise-ready multi-workspace support (see archived PR plan below)

## Archived: Multi-Workspace Support Implementation Plan

‚è∫ Detailed Pull Request Implementation Plan for Multi-Workspace Support

The refactor-guardian has created a comprehensive 10-PR implementation plan to transform the
single-workspace architecture into a proper multi-tenant system. Here's the strategic breakdown:

üìã Implementation Overview

* Total PRs: 10 sequential pull requests
* Timeline: 10-13 weeks
* Risk Profile: Gradual increase from LOW to HIGH
* Strategy: Maintain backward compatibility until PR #7
