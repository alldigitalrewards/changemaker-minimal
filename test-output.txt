# Test Results Summary - January 03, 2025

## Test Execution Status

### Local Environment Tests
- **Command**: `pnpm playwright test --reporter=list` (run in background)
- **Status**: In Progress (50+ minutes runtime, still executing)
- **Progress**: 120+ tests executed out of 500 total
- **Results**: 15 passed ✓, 105 failed ✘
- **Pass Rate**: ~12.5%

### Preview Environment Tests
- **Command**: `pnpm test:e2e:preview`
- **Status**: Timeout after 120 seconds
- **Target**: https://preview.changemaker.im
- **Note**: Tests started executing but did not complete within timeout.

## Key Findings

### Test Configuration
- Total tests discovered: 120 tests across chromium, firefox, webkit
- Test files located in: `tests/e2e/`, `tests/api/`
- Running with 4 workers in parallel

### Running Processes
Multiple next-server and playwright processes detected:
- next-server (v15.3.2) instances running
- playwright test-server active on port (test UI mode)
- Local dev server on port 3000

### Failed/Incomplete Tests Observed

#### Preview Environment Issues:
1. **Challenge Reward Config Test** - API response validation failure
2. **Email Change Flow Tests** - Route not found (404 on /account)
3. **Complete Challenge Flow** - Timeout waiting for admin dashboard
4. **Admin Route Testing** - 500 error on /admin/settings route
5. **Participant Journey** - Missing `expiresAt` field in invite code creation
6. **Review Approval UI** - Timeout waiting for approve button

### Common Error Patterns:
- Page not found (404) errors on account routes
- Database validation errors (missing required fields)
- Workspace access denied errors
- Timeout issues on navigation/button clicks
- API endpoint returning 500 errors

## Test Suite Breakdown

### API Tests (~50 tests):
- Challenge CRUD operations
- Email change workflow
- Enrollment management
- Participants management
- Reward issuance system

### E2E Flow Tests (~70 tests):
- Admin workflows
- Participant journey
- Email change flows
- Challenge completion flows
- Route crawling tests

## Recommendations

1. **Performance**: Tests are timing out - consider increasing timeout limits or optimizing test execution
2. **Cleanup**: Multiple dev servers running - may need to stop conflicting processes
3. **Environment**: Preview environment has routing/API issues that need investigation
4. **Database**: Schema validation errors suggest missing required fields (e.g., expiresAt on InviteCode)
5. **Stability**: Several 500 errors and navigation timeouts indicate application stability issues

## Next Steps

To complete full test runs:
1. Stop all running dev servers and test processes
2. Run tests with extended timeout: `timeout 300 pnpm test`
3. Run tests in headed mode for debugging: `pnpm playwright test --headed`
4. Run specific failing tests individually to investigate root causes
5. Fix database schema issues (InviteCode.expiresAt requirement)
6. Investigate preview environment routing issues (/account route 404s)
