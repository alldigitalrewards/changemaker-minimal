# TODAY'S BUILD FOCUS (Minimal MVP)

## Core Implementation Path:

### Simple Supabase Auth (2 components only)

- Login page with email/password
- Signup page with role selection
- No JWT complexity, no Redis, just Supabase sessions

### Basic Middleware (50 lines max)

- Check if user is logged in
- Check user role (ADMIN or PARTICIPANT)
- Redirect to login if not authenticated

### Workspace Flow (3 pages)

- /workspaces - Simple list of user's workspaces
- Create workspace button (admins only)
- Click to enter workspace â†’ /w/[slug]

### Admin Features (Already have challenge creation)

- View participants list
- That's it for MVP

### Participant Features (2 pages)

- /w/[slug]/participant/dashboard - Show enrolled challenges
- /w/[slug]/participant/challenges - Browse & enroll

### Single API for Enrollment

- POST /api/workspaces/[slug]/enrollments - Enroll in challenge
- GET to fetch user's enrollments

## What We're NOT Building:

- No analytics
- No email notifications (except Supabase auth emails)
- No gamification/points/rewards
- No audit logging
- No A/B testing
- No Redis caching
- No complex permissions
- No billing
- No content management
- No help documentation
- No command palette
- No global search
- No performance monitoring

### Database Stays Simple:

```typescript
model User {
    id, email, role, workspaceId, supabaseUserId
  }
  model Workspace {
    id, slug, name
  }
  model Challenge {
    id, title, description, workspaceId
  }
  model Enrollment {
    id, userId, challengeId, status
  }
```

  *That's it. 4 models, not 30+.*

### The Result:

  A working multi-tenant challenge platform that:

- Admins can create workspaces and challenges
- Participants can join and enroll
- Everything is properly authenticated
- Zero unnecessary complexity

  This is achievable in a day, maintainable by one person, and provides the core business value without the 2000+ files of bloat from the
  original.
