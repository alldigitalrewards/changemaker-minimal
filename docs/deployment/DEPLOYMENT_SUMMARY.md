## Critical Path to Production

### Step 1: Create Supabase Auth Users (5 minutes)
**Who**: Tech Lead with Supabase dashboard access
**Action**: Create test users in Supabase Auth:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
2. Create user: `jfelke@alldigitalrewards.com` / `Changemaker2025!`
3. Create user: `john.doe@acme.com` / `Changemaker2025!`
4. Confirm users are active (check email confirmation if needed)

### Step 2: Validate Preview Deployment (10 minutes)
**Who**: QA Engineer or Dev
**Action**: Run preview tests

```bash
# Run E2E tests against preview deployment
pnpm test tests/preview/preview-deployment.spec.ts --reporter=list

# Expected result: 7/7 tests passing
# - TC1: Login Flow ✅
# - TC2: Session Persistence ✅
# - TC3: Workspaces Dashboard ✅
# - TC4: Points Reward Creation ✅
# - TC5: Password Reset ✅
# - TC6: Workspace Isolation ✅
# - TC7: Dynamic Reward Display ✅
```

**If tests fail**:
- Check Supabase Auth users created correctly
- Verify credentials match test expectations
- Check preview deployment logs in Vercel
- Consult `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md` for troubleshooting

### Step 3: Production Deployment (automatic, ~5 minutes)
**Who**: Dev with merge rights
**Action**: Merge PR #44

```bash
# Option 1: Via GitHub UI
# Click "Merge pull request" on PR #44

# Option 2: Via CLI
gh pr merge 44 --squash --auto

# Vercel will automatically:
# 1. Build the application (~2 min)
# 2. Run Prisma migrations
# 3. Deploy to changemaker.im
# 4. Switch traffic to new deployment
```

### Step 4: Post-Deployment Verification (15 minutes)
**Who**: Team (Dev + QA)
**Action**: Verify production deployment

```bash
# 1. Health check
curl https://changemaker.im/api/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok","database":"connected"}

# 2. Manual smoke tests
# - Login as admin
# - Create challenge (all 3 reward types)
# - Enroll as participant
# - View workspaces dashboard
# - Test email change (optional)

# 3. Check Vercel logs
vercel logs changemaker-minimal --scope alldigitalrewards

# 4. Monitor analytics
# Vercel Dashboard → changemaker-minimal → Analytics
```

### Step 5: Monitoring (24 hours)
**Who**: DevOps / On-call
**Action**: Monitor production metrics

- **Hour 1**: Active monitoring of error rates
- **Hour 6**: Check for any unusual patterns
- **Hour 24**: Final verification and sign-off

**Key Metrics**:
- Error rate (should remain <1%)
- Response times (should be <500ms p95)
- Database connection pool (should not max out)
- Email delivery rate (should be >95%)

```

#### Database Rollback (if needed, 5-10 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Restore from backup
psql $DATABASE_URL < backup-pre-deployment.sql
