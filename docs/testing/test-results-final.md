✓ Generating static pages (48 static, 30+ dynamic)
```

**Route Verification**:
- ✅ Auth routes (/auth/login, /auth/register)
- ✅ Workspaces listing (/workspaces)
- ✅ Admin routes (/w/[slug]/admin/*)
- ✅ Participant routes (/w/[slug]/participant/*)
- ✅ API routes (challenges, enrollments, submissions, rewards)

## Automated Test Suite

### Execution Status
**Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL
- **Issue**: Login flow timeouts causing cascading test failures
- **Root Cause**: Auth helper `loginWithCredentials()` times out waiting for redirect
- **Total Tests Attempted**: 100 tests across API, E2E, and integration suites
- **Tests Failed**: 36+ tests (all due to login timeout in beforeEach hooks)

### Test Categories

#### API Tests (tests/api/)
**Status**: ❌ BLOCKED BY AUTH
- Challenge CRUD API
- Enrollment API
- Submissions API
- Reward Issuance API
- Participants API
- Email Change API

**Blocker**: All tests timeout during login in `beforeEach` hook at 30 seconds

#### Integration Tests (tests/integration/)
**Status**: UNKNOWN (not executed due to earlier failures)
- Database integration tests
- Multi-tenancy tests

#### E2E Tests (tests/e2e/)
**Status**: UNKNOWN (blocked by same auth issue)
- Complete challenge flow
- Review approval UI
- Invite flow
- Admin crawl tests
- Rewards approval flow

### Auth Flow Issue Details

**Location**: `/tests/e2e/support/auth.ts:12`

**Problem**:
```typescript
await page.waitForURL((url) =>
  url.pathname === '/workspaces' ||
  url.searchParams.get('redirectTo') !== null
)
```

The login redirect isn't happening as expected, causing 30-second timeouts.

**Test Framework Configuration**:
- Framework: Playwright
- Timeout: 30 seconds (default)
- Workers: 4 parallel workers
- Browser: Chromium (Desktop Chrome)

## Conclusion

The Changemaker application shows strong technical fundamentals:
- Clean production build
- Type-safe codebase
- Comprehensive database schema
- Multi-tenancy working
- Reward system implemented

However, the test suite is completely blocked by an auth flow issue that must be resolved before production deployment. The database evidence confirms features are implemented and working, but manual verification is required to confirm UI functionality.

**Next Steps**:
1. Debug and fix auth test helper (highest priority)
2. Run full automated test suite
3. Complete manual testing checklist
4. Fix any bugs discovered
5. Re-run full verification
6. Deploy to staging for final validation
