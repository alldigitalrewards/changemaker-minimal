# Test Suite Status Summary

**Date**: October 6, 2025
**Branch**: global-account-workspace-visibility-leaderboard-multi-reward

## Summary

We've made significant progress fixing the test suite. The main issues fixed were:

1. **Playwright Configuration** - Changed from full build + production server to dev server reuse
2. **Database Seeding** - Ensured seed data exists for tests
3. **Enum Case Sensitivity** - Fixed RewardType enum validation to accept both uppercase and lowercase
4. **Browser Configuration** - Disabled cross-browser testing to speed up development

## Current Status

### ✅ Integration Tests: PASSING (18/18)
All integration tests are now passing:
- Database schema tests
- Multi-tenancy isolation tests
- Foreign key and cascade tests
- Enum and JSON field tests

### ⚠️ API Tests: PARTIAL (19/58 passing, 38 failing, 1 skipped)
Main remaining issues:
- Reward type validation still rejecting uppercase values despite fix (dev server may need restart)
- Some challenge creation tests failing validation
- Email change tests need verification
- Enrollment and submission tests need review

## Changes Made

1. **playwright.config.ts**
   - Changed webServer to use `pnpm dev` instead of `pnpm build && pnpm start`
   - Set `reuseExistingServer: true` for faster testing
   - Disabled Firefox, WebKit, and mobile browsers (chromium only)
   - Reduced timeout from 240s to 120s

2. **lib/types.ts**
   - Updated `validateChallengeData()` to accept case-insensitive rewardType values
   - Normalizes to lowercase before validation

3. **tests/integration/database.spec.ts**
   - Fixed `rewardType: 'POINTS'` to `rewardType: 'points'` (lowercase)
   - Added workspace existence assertions to prevent foreign key errors

4. **tests/integration/multi-tenancy.spec.ts**
   - Fixed `type: 'POINTS'` to `type: 'points'` (lowercase)

5. **prisma/seed.ts**
   - Already seeded with 3 workspaces, challenges, users, etc.

## Next Steps

1. **Restart Dev Server** - The code changes may not be reflected yet
   ```bash
   # Kill existing dev server
   lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
   
   # Start fresh
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. **Re-run API Tests** - After server restart
   ```bash
   pnpm test tests/api --reporter=list
   ```

3. **Fix Remaining Issues**:
   - Challenge validation errors (may be fixed by server restart)
   - Email change API tests
   - Participant/enrollment tests
   - Review/submission workflow tests

4. **Run E2E Tests** - Once API tests pass
   ```bash
   pnpm test tests/e2e/flows --reporter=list
   ```

5. **Full Suite** - Final verification
   ```bash
   pnpm test
   ```

```

## Known Issues

1. **Dev Server Hot Reload** - Code changes may require manual server restart
2. **Test Timeouts** - Some tests still timing out due to slow compilation
3. **Uppercase Enum Values** - Tests use uppercase but DB expects lowercase (normalization added but may need server restart)

## Environment

- Node: v22.x
- pnpm: v9.x
- Playwright: Latest
- Next.js: 15.3.2
- Prisma: 6.15.0
