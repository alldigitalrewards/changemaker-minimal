# Title: Build Participant Dashboard
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: low
# Description: Build participant dashboard at /app/w/[slug]/participant showing their PointsBalance, PointTransaction history, challenge progression, and ActivitySubmission status. Display earned points from completed activities, available challenges with potential points, and submission progress using existing models and shadcn/ui components.
# Details:
Create participant-focused dashboard components using existing models (PointsBalance, PointTransaction, Challenge, ActivityTemplate, ActivitySubmission) and shadcn/ui library. Build PointsBalance display with earned points from completed activities, PointTransaction history table, challenge progression tracker showing available challenges with potential points from ActivityTemplate.basePoints, and ActivitySubmission status indicators. Focus on participant experience with proper data filtering and user context.

# Test Strategy:
Test participant dashboard components using Cypress and Jest for functionality, data integration with existing models, and responsive behavior. Verify proper participant data isolation and user experience flows.
