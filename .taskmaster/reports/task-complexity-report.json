			"taskTitle": "Database Schema Migration for RewardSTACK Integration",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the migration into: (1) schema design and field/table specification, (2) Prisma schema updates, (3) migration script creation with add-only changes, (4) sensitive field encryption setup, (5) migration execution and validation on staging, (6) index creation and verification, (7) rollback/backup planning, (8) migration testing and documentation.",
			"reasoning": "Database schema migrations are inherently complex due to risks of downtime, locking, and compatibility issues, especially in production environments[1][2]. This migration involves multiple tables, sensitive data encryption, and index management, all of which require careful planning, phased execution, and thorough testing. Add-only migrations reduce risk but still require coordination and validation. Industry best practices recommend breaking down such migrations into granular steps, including backup, validation, and rollback planning[2][3]."

			"taskId": 43,
			"taskTitle": "Implement RewardSTACK Authentication Layer",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) JWT bearer token generation logic, (2) in-memory token caching and auto-refresh, (3) error handling and audit logging, (4) secure storage and encryption of API keys, (5) unit testing for all scenarios.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing a robust authentication layer with JWT, caching, and refresh logic is moderately complex. It requires secure key management, error handling for external API failures, and audit logging. While standard libraries exist, integrating them securely and ensuring reliability under error conditions adds to the effort. Testing for expiry, refresh, and error scenarios is essential for production readiness."

			"taskId": 44,
			"taskTitle": "Admin RewardSTACK Configuration UI",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) UI form layout and field validation, (2) integration with backend test connection API, (3) connection status and health indicator logic, (4) error/success toast notifications, (5) accessibility and responsive design checks.",
			"reasoning": "Building a configuration UI with form validation, secure input handling, and backend integration is a standard React/Next.js task. Complexity arises from integrating real-time connection testing, handling sensitive fields, and ensuring a responsive, accessible UI. However, established patterns and libraries (e.g., Tailwind, React server components) help manage this complexity."

		{
			"taskId": 45,
			"taskTitle": "API Route: Test RewardSTACK Connection",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: (1) admin authentication middleware, (2) JWT generation and RewardSTACK API call, (3) response formatting and error handling, (4) API route unit/integration tests.",
			"reasoning": "This API route is straightforward, involving authentication, a single external API call, and response handling. Complexity is limited to secure handling of credentials and robust error management. Testing for valid/invalid credentials and error scenarios is necessary but not unusually challenging."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 46,
			"taskTitle": "API Route: Update RewardSTACK Configuration",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) admin authentication and input validation, (2) API key encryption and secure storage, (3) transactional DB update logic, (4) audit logging integration, (5) API tests for all update scenarios.",
			"reasoning": "Updating sensitive configuration via API requires secure input validation, encryption, and transactional updates to prevent partial writes. Audit logging adds traceability. While each step is standard, combining them securely and reliably increases complexity."

			"taskId": 47,
			"taskTitle": "Participant Sync Service for RewardSTACK",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) participant create/update/get API integration, (2) error and duplicate handling logic, (3) integration with reward issuance flow, (4) atomic DB operations with Prisma transactions, (5) unit and integration testing for sync scenarios.",
			"reasoning": "Automating participant sync with external APIs, handling duplicates, validation, and integrating with transactional reward issuance is complex. Ensuring atomicity and robust error handling, especially with retries and external dependencies, requires careful design and thorough testing."

		{
			"taskId": 50,
			"taskTitle": "RewardSTACK Webhook Handler",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: (1) webhook endpoint and signature verification, (2) event parsing and handling logic, (3) RewardIssuance status update and ActivityEvent logging, (4) error handling and response, (5) API tests for all event types.",
			"reasoning": "Webhook handlers must be secure (signature verification), idempotent, and robust against malformed or replayed events. Updating internal state and logging for audit trails adds to the complexity. Testing for all event types and error scenarios is critical for reliability."

		{
			"taskId": 51,
			"taskTitle": "Admin Reward Management and Reconciliation Dashboard",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) reward issuance table with filters and pagination, (2) manual/bulk retry integration, (3) error details and status display, (4) CSV export functionality, (5) performance optimization for large datasets, (6) UI/UX and accessibility checks.",
			"reasoning": "Building a dashboard with real-time data, filtering, retry actions, and export features involves both backend query optimization and frontend complexity. Handling large datasets efficiently and integrating with retry APIs increases the implementation and testing effort."

			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: (1) admin authentication and input validation, (2) reward issuance retry logic by type, (3) status update and error handling, (4) audit logging, (5) API tests for retry scenarios.",
			"reasoning": "Retrying failed operations via API is moderately complex, requiring safe idempotency, correct status management, and robust error handling. Integrating with existing reward logic and ensuring auditability are important but follow established patterns."

			"taskId": 58,
			"taskTitle": "Admin Dashboard Reward Stats and Alerts",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) stats widget implementation (totals, rates, top types), (2) failed rewards alert logic, (3) recent activity feed, (4) efficient backend queries and groupBy, (5) UI/integration tests.",
			"reasoning": "Adding dashboard widgets for stats and alerts is a common UI enhancement. The main complexity lies in efficient data aggregation and ensuring real-time accuracy, but this is manageable with modern ORM and query tools."
