# Product Requirements Document - Changemaker Platform Enhancement
## Challenge Progression and Rewards System

### Executive Summary
Implement a comprehensive challenge progression system with point-based rewards, wallet management, and approval workflows. This enhancement will provide gamification elements to increase user engagement while preparing for future RewardSTACK API integration.

### Feature Set 1: Challenge Progression System
The challenge progression feature will track participant progress through multiple stages from initial submission to final verification and reward issuance.

#### Requirements:
- Implement challenge progression states: submitted, approved, in_development, in_production, verified, completed
- Create activity templates that define point values for different challenge activities
- Build submission tracking system for participant documentation
- Implement approval workflow for admin review and validation
- Add progression visualization for participants to track their status
- Create notifications for state transitions
- Implement rollback capability for rejected submissions

### Feature Set 2: Mock Point System and Wallets
Develop a mock point system with wallet functionality for testing reward mechanics before RewardSTACK integration.

#### Requirements:
- Design database schema for points, wallets, and transactions
- Implement user wallet system with point balance tracking
- Create admin workspace wallets for point distribution testing
- Build point allocation system based on activity templates
- Implement point awarding upon challenge approval
- Create transaction history and audit trail
- Add point balance display in participant dashboard
- Implement mock point transfers between wallets
- Build adapter pattern interface for future RewardSTACK API integration
- Create configuration system for point values and multipliers

### Feature Set 3: Admin Wallet and Funding System
Implement workspace-level admin wallets for managing and distributing points within each workspace.

#### Requirements:
- Create workspace wallet entity separate from user wallets
- Implement funding mechanism for workspace wallets
- Build point distribution controls for admins
- Add budget tracking and remaining balance displays
- Create approval limits and authorization levels
- Implement mock integration points for R.A. (Reporting and Accounting) system
- Design abstraction layer for future Stripe payment integration
- Add workspace wallet analytics and reporting

### Feature Set 4: Enhanced Participant Management
Upgrade the admin participant management interface with advanced filtering and bulk actions.

#### Requirements:
- Implement advanced filtering by status, points, enrollment date, activity level
- Add sorting capabilities for all participant attributes
- Create bulk action functionality (approve, reject, award points)
- Implement participant search with autocomplete
- Add participant profile quick view modal
- Create participant activity timeline view
- Implement export functionality for participant data
- Add participant grouping and tagging system
- Create participant invitation system with email templates
- Build participant onboarding flow tracking

### Feature Set 5: Integration Preparation Layer
Build the foundation for future RewardSTACK and payment system integrations.

#### Requirements:
- Design service interface for reward fulfillment APIs
- Create mock RewardSTACK service with simulated responses
- Implement configuration system for API endpoints and credentials
- Build error handling and retry logic for external services
- Create mapping system between internal points and external reward values
- Implement webhook handlers for async reward processing
- Design queue system for reward fulfillment requests
- Add monitoring and alerting for integration health
- Create fallback mechanisms for service unavailability
- Build integration testing framework

### Technical Requirements

#### Database Schema Updates:
- Add Wallet model with userId, workspaceId, balance, type fields
- Create Transaction model for point movements
- Add ActivityTemplate model for point value definitions
- Extend Challenge model with progression state fields
- Create ChallengeSubmission model for participant documentation
- Add ApprovalHistory model for audit trail

#### API Endpoints:
- POST /api/w/[slug]/wallets - Create wallet
- GET /api/w/[slug]/wallets/[id] - Get wallet details
- POST /api/w/[slug]/wallets/[id]/transactions - Create transaction
- GET /api/w/[slug]/participants/[id]/points - Get participant points
- POST /api/w/[slug]/challenges/[id]/submissions - Submit documentation
- PUT /api/w/[slug]/challenges/[id]/submissions/[submissionId]/approve - Approve submission
- GET /api/w/[slug]/admin/participants - Enhanced participant list with filters
- POST /api/w/[slug]/admin/participants/bulk-action - Bulk operations
- POST /api/w/[slug]/admin/workspace-wallet/fund - Fund workspace wallet
- GET /api/w/[slug]/activity-templates - Get point value configurations

#### UI Components:
- PointBalance component for displaying user points
- WalletCard component for wallet summary
- TransactionHistory component for transaction list
- ProgressionTracker component for challenge status
- ParticipantFilter component for advanced filtering
- BulkActionToolbar component for multi-select operations
- ActivityTemplateEditor for configuring point values
- ApprovalQueue component for pending submissions
- WorkspaceWalletManager for admin wallet controls

### Security Considerations
- Implement transaction validation to prevent negative balances
- Add rate limiting for point-related operations
- Create audit logging for all wallet transactions
- Implement role-based access for wallet management
- Add encryption for sensitive wallet data
- Implement idempotency keys for transaction creation
- Create fraud detection rules for abnormal point movements

### Performance Requirements
- Wallet balance queries must respond within 200ms
- Bulk participant operations should handle up to 100 records
- Transaction history should paginate at 50 records
- Point calculations must be atomic and consistent
- Implement caching for frequently accessed wallet data

### Migration Strategy
- Phase 1: Deploy mock system with dummy data
- Phase 2: Beta test with selected workspaces
- Phase 3: Gradual rollout to all workspaces
- Phase 4: RewardSTACK integration preparation
- Phase 5: Production RewardSTACK integration

### Success Metrics
- User engagement increase of 30% through gamification
- 90% of participants viewing their point balance weekly
- Admin satisfaction score > 4.5/5 for participant management
- Zero point calculation errors in production
- Successful processing of 95% of reward fulfillments

### Dependencies
- Existing authentication and workspace system
- Current challenge and enrollment infrastructure
- Supabase database and Prisma ORM
- Next.js API routes and server actions
- shadcn/ui component library

### Timeline Estimates
- Mock Point System: 2-3 sprints
- Wallet Implementation: 1-2 sprints
- Participant Management: 1 sprint
- Integration Prep: 2 sprints
- Testing and Refinement: 1 sprint

### Risk Mitigation
- Design with clear abstraction boundaries to prevent lock-in
- Implement comprehensive testing for point calculations
- Create rollback procedures for failed transactions
- Document all integration points thoroughly
- Build monitoring dashboards for system health
- Establish clear data migration paths
