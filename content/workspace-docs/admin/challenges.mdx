# Managing Challenges

As a workspace admin, you have full control over challenge creation, configuration, and management. This guide covers everything you need to know about running successful challenges.

## Creating a Challenge

### Basic Setup

1. Navigate to **Admin > Challenges**
2. Click **Create Challenge**
3. Complete the required fields:

```typescript
{
  title: "Innovation Challenge 2024",
  description: "Submit your best ideas for improving our product",
  startDate: "2024-01-01",
  endDate: "2024-03-31"
}
```

### Challenge Configuration

#### Enrollment Settings

Control who can participate:

- **Open Enrollment**: Anyone in the workspace can join
- **Invitation Only**: Participants must be invited
- **Approval Required**: Admins review enrollment requests

#### Submission Requirements

Define what participants need to submit:

- Text descriptions
- File uploads (documents, images, videos)
- Links to external resources
- Custom form fields

#### Evaluation Criteria

Set how submissions will be judged:

- **Automated**: Based on completion and requirements
- **Manual Review**: Admin approval required
- **Peer Voting**: Participants vote on submissions
- **Hybrid**: Combination of methods

## Managing Participants

### Viewing Enrollments

Track who's participating:

```sql
SELECT
  u.email,
  e.status,
  e.created_at
FROM enrollments e
JOIN users u ON e.user_id = u.id
WHERE e.challenge_id = 'challenge-uuid'
ORDER BY e.created_at DESC
```

### Sending Communications

Keep participants informed:

- **Announcements**: Broadcast updates to all participants
- **Reminders**: Automated deadline notifications
- **Direct Messages**: One-on-one communication

## Reviewing Submissions

### Submission Dashboard

Access all submissions from **Admin > Challenges > [Challenge Name] > Submissions**

Each submission shows:
- Participant information
- Submission content
- Timestamp
- Current status

### Approval Workflow

1. **Review**: Examine submission details
2. **Evaluate**: Check against criteria
3. **Decide**: Approve, reject, or request changes
4. **Notify**: Participant receives automatic notification

### Bulk Actions

Handle multiple submissions efficiently:

- **Approve Selected**: Approve multiple submissions at once
- **Export Data**: Download submission details as CSV
- **Filter by Status**: View only pending, approved, or rejected

## Reward Distribution

### Configure Rewards

Set up reward rules:

1. Navigate to **Challenge Settings > Rewards**
2. Choose reward type:
   - Fixed amount per completion
   - Tiered based on performance
   - Random drawings
   - Top N winners

3. Connect to RewardStack:

```typescript
{
  apiKey: process.env.REWARDSTACK_API_KEY,
  skuId: "reward-sku-id",
  distributionRule: "automatic_on_approval"
}
```

### Issue Rewards

Distribute rewards to winners:

1. Select approved submissions
2. Click **Issue Rewards**
3. Confirm SKU and quantity
4. Track distribution status

### Monitor Rewards

View reward distribution:

- **Pending**: Queued for distribution
- **Issued**: Sent to RewardStack
- **Claimed**: Participant redeemed
- **Failed**: Requires attention

## Challenge Analytics

### Engagement Metrics

Track challenge performance:

- **Total Enrollments**: Number of participants
- **Submission Rate**: Percentage who submitted
- **Completion Rate**: Percentage who completed
- **Average Time**: Time from enrollment to submission

### Participation Trends

Visualize activity over time:

- Daily enrollment graph
- Submission timeline
- Peak engagement periods
- Drop-off points

## Best Practices

### Clear Communication

- Write detailed challenge descriptions
- Set realistic deadlines
- Provide submission examples
- Clarify evaluation criteria

### Timely Management

- Review submissions promptly
- Respond to participant questions
- Send reminder notifications
- Celebrate successes

### Fair Evaluation

- Use consistent criteria
- Document decision rationale
- Provide constructive feedback
- Maintain transparency

## Troubleshooting

### Low Enrollment

If participation is low:

1. **Review messaging**: Is the challenge clearly explained?
2. **Check visibility**: Are participants aware of the challenge?
3. **Assess barriers**: Are requirements too restrictive?
4. **Increase promotion**: Send additional announcements

### High Drop-off Rate

If participants enroll but don't complete:

1. **Simplify requirements**: Reduce submission complexity
2. **Extend deadline**: Give more time
3. **Send reminders**: Nudge inactive participants
4. **Offer support**: Provide help resources

### Reward Issues

If reward distribution fails:

1. **Verify RewardStack connection**: Check API credentials
2. **Confirm SKU availability**: Ensure rewards are in stock
3. **Review error logs**: Check for specific error messages
4. **Contact support**: Escalate persistent issues

## Advanced Features

### Custom Fields

Add workspace-specific data to challenges:

```typescript
{
  customFields: [
    {
      name: "department",
      type: "select",
      required: true,
      options: ["Engineering", "Design", "Marketing"]
    },
    {
      name: "budget_impact",
      type: "number",
      required: false
    }
  ]
}
```

### Automated Workflows

Set up rules for automatic actions:

- Auto-approve submissions meeting criteria
- Trigger reward distribution on completion
- Send notifications at specific stages
- Archive completed challenges

### API Integration

Integrate challenges with external systems via API. See [API Reference](/docs/api-reference/challenges) for details.
