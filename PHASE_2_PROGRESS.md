**Status**: In Progress
**Started**: 2025-01-10
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-10

## Overview

Phase 2 focuses on implementing superadmin-level administrative features and visual polish for the workspace dashboard, building on the performance optimizations from Phase 1.

---

## Completed Features ✅

### 1. Platform Overview Cards Component
**File**: `components/admin/platform-overview-cards.tsx`

Created a professional platform statistics dashboard component featuring:
- Total Workspaces card (purple theme for superadmin)
- Total Users card with platform-wide metrics
- Total Challenges card
- Total Points Awarded card
- Trend indicators (up/down arrows with percentage)
- Purple gradient styling for superadmin elements

### 2. Platform-Level Database Queries
**File**: `lib/db/queries.ts` (lines 2462-2627)

Added three new platform-level query functions:

#### `getPlatformStats(tenantId)`
- Aggregates metrics across all workspaces
- Returns total/active workspaces, users, challenges, points
- Calculates 30-day trends for all metrics
- Optimized with parallel queries

#### `getAllWorkspacesWithDetails(tenantId)`
- Returns all workspaces with membership and challenge counts
- Includes list of admin users (up to 5) per workspace
- Ordered by creation date

#### `getAllPlatformUsers()`
- Returns all users with their workspace memberships
- Includes workspace details (id, slug, name)
- Shows role and primary workspace status

###3. Superadmin Dashboard Page
**File**: `app/admin/dashboard.tsx`

Created the main superadmin platform overview page:
- Authorization check using `isPlatformSuperAdmin()`
- Displays platform statistics with `PlatformOverviewCards`
- Quick action links to manage workspaces and users
- Purple theme throughout for superadmin branding
- Redirects non-superadmins to `/workspaces`

### 4. Build Cleanup
- Removed Storybook configuration (`.storybook/` directory)
- Removed Storybook stories (`stories/` directory)
- Removed Storybook scripts from `package.json`
- Removed Storybook dependencies from devDependencies
- Build now succeeds without Storybook-related errors

    text: 'text-purple-700',
    border: 'border-purple-300',
    icon: 'text-purple-600'
  },
  ADMIN: {
    bg: 'bg-coral-100',
    bgHover: 'bg-coral-200',
    text: 'text-coral-700',
    border: 'border-coral-300',
    icon: 'text-coral-600'
  },
  PARTICIPANT: {
    bg: 'bg-blue-100',
    bgHover: 'bg-blue-200',
    text: 'text-blue-700',
    border: 'border-blue-300',
    icon: 'text-blue-600'
  }
}
```

Apply throughout:
- All role badges
- Navigation sections
- Dashboard headers
- Action buttons

#### 6. Status Indicators and Badges
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Files**: `components/ui/status-badge.tsx`, `components/ui/role-badge.tsx`

Components needed:
- `StatusBadge`: Workspace status (Active=green, Inactive=gray, Archived=red)
- `RoleBadge`: User roles with color coding from theme
- `MembershipCountBadge`: Show member counts with proper formatting
- `PermissionBadge`: Indicate special permissions (e.g., superadmin)

#### 7. Contextual Action Buttons
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Files**: Multiple components

Add role-specific action buttons:
- Platform Settings (superadmin only)
- Manage Members (admin/superadmin)
- View Analytics (admin/superadmin)
- Quick actions dropdowns with role-aware options
- Consistent button styling with role colors

#### 8. Enhanced Typography Hierarchy
**Priority**: Low
**Files**: Multiple components (TO UPDATE)

Apply consistent typography:
- h1 (text-3xl font-bold): Platform-level headings (superadmin pages)
- h2 (text-2xl font-semibold): Workspace-level headings
- h3 (text-lg font-semibold): Section headings
- Body (text-base): Regular content
- Small (text-sm): Helper text, metadata
- Role-based text colors where appropriate

## Integration Points

### Pages Created/Updated

#### New Pages ✅
1. `/app/admin/workspaces/page.tsx` - Administrative workspace management ✅
2. `/app/admin/users/page.tsx` - Membership management interface ✅

#### Existing Pages to Update
1. `/app/w/[slug]/admin/dashboard/page.tsx` - Add superadmin-specific features conditionally
2. `/components/navigation/admin-sidebar.tsx` - Add superadmin navigation items

---

## Technical Architecture

### Authorization Pattern
All superadmin features use:
```typescript
import { isPlatformSuperAdmin } from '@/lib/auth/rbac'

const isSuperAdmin = isPlatformSuperAdmin(user.permissions || [], user.email)

if (!isSuperAdmin) {
  redirect('/workspaces')
}
```

### Theme Pattern
- **Purple**: Superadmin features (borders, backgrounds, icons)
- **Coral**: Regular admin features
- **Blue**: Participant features
- **Gray**: Neutral/shared elements

### Component Patterns
- Use shadcn/ui components (Card, Table, Button, Badge, Dialog, etc.)
- Follow existing patterns from workspace admin dashboard
- Maintain workspace isolation for non-superadmin queries
- Use optimized queries with parallel fetching
- Implement proper loading states with Suspense boundaries

---
