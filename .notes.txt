Based on your query, I searched the workspace for code and documentation that are leftovers from the original Vercel Platforms template. I looked for keywords like "vercel", "platforms", "subdomain", "KV_", "Upstash", and "redis", since these are related to the template's multi-tenancy (subdomains), caching (Upstash Redis), and Vercel-specific deployment.

The search found 134 matching lines in documentation, code, and config files. This shows there are still template artifacts—especially subdomain logic and Redis integrations—that conflict with your path-based MVP refactor. These add unnecessary complexity and dependencies that aren't needed for your core features.

Summary of findings and recommended actions:

1. Documentation Files:
- TODAY.md: Mentions avoiding Redis. No change needed.
- README.md: Contains template instructions about subdomains and Redis. Update to reflect path-based workspaces and remove template references.
- CLAUDE.md: Mentions the Vercel template and avoiding Redis. Keep as reminders, but clarify that subdomains are not used.
- REFACTOR_GUIDE.md and REFACTOR.md: Reference cloning the template, subdomains, and Redis. Archive or delete if outdated.

2. Dependency/Config Files:
- package.json: Includes "@upstash/redis", "@vercel/analytics", and "@vercel/speed-insights". Remove these dependencies.
- pnpm-lock.yaml: Contains locks for the above packages. Regenerate the lockfile after removing the dependencies.
- next.config.ts: Has a comment about Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights. Delete this comment.

3. Code Files:
- app/admin/dashboard.tsx: Contains subdomain management UI. Delete or refactor to use path-based workspace management.
- app/actions.ts: Contains Redis-based actions for subdomains. Delete or refactor to use Prisma (no Redis or subdomains).
- lib/subdomains.ts: Contains Redis logic for subdomains. Delete this file.
- lib/redis.ts: Contains Redis client setup. Delete this file.
- app/s/[subdomain]/page.tsx: Dynamic subdomain page. Delete this file/directory.
- app/page.tsx: Imports SubdomainForm. Remove if it's template bloat and refactor to a static landing page.

Recommendations:
- Most matches are in docs (easy to update), some in dependencies (remove to reduce bloat), and some in code (highest priority to remove per your refactor goals).
- Immediate actions:
  1. Remove the unnecessary dependencies.
  2. Delete the files related to subdomains and Redis.
  3. Refactor code to remove subdomain/Redis references.
  4. Update documentation to remove template instructions.
- After cleanup, re-run the search to confirm all template remnants are gone, then build and test the project.

This cleanup will remove the template leftovers and keep your refactor minimal and focused.
