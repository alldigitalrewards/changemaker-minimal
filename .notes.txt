Template Cleanup Summary (Completed):
- Dependencies Removed: @upstash/redis, @vercel/analytics, @vercel/speed-insights. Ran `pnpm install` to update lockfile.
- Files Deleted: lib/subdomains.ts, lib/redis.ts, app/s/[subdomain]/page.tsx.
- Code Refactored:
  - app/admin/dashboard.tsx: Removed subdomain UI; replaced with MVP workspace placeholder.
  - app/actions.ts: Removed subdomain/Redis actions; added minimal placeholder.
  - app/page.tsx: Removed SubdomainForm; replaced with static home placeholder.
  - next.config.ts: Removed Vercel comment; simplified config.
- Verification: Re-run grep should show no matches (except intentional docs). Build/test to confirm.

All template remnants purgedâ€”repo is now clean for path-based MVP.
